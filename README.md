"Duration": 4 Weeks

"Mentor": Neela Santosh

## Code description
The Internship Task-3 titled “Security Testing for Web Applications” provided by CODTECH is designed to give interns practical exposure to one of the most critical areas of modern software development—web application security. In today’s digital environment, web applications are widely used for handling sensitive information such as user credentials, financial data, and personal records. Because of this, they are common targets for cyberattacks. This task aims to help interns understand how vulnerabilities arise in web applications, how attackers exploit them, and how developers and security testers can identify and mitigate such risks before they cause real-world damage. The task emphasizes learning through hands-on testing rather than just theoretical knowledge, which is essential for building a strong foundation in cybersecurity.

The primary objective of this task is to conduct security testing on a sample web application in order to identify common vulnerabilities. Interns are expected to analyze the application’s input fields, authentication mechanisms, and data handling processes to detect security flaws. Among the key vulnerabilities highlighted in the task are SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which are two of the most frequently exploited weaknesses in web applications. SQL Injection occurs when an application fails to properly validate user input and directly includes it in database queries, allowing attackers to manipulate the query and gain unauthorized access to data. Cross-Site Scripting, on the other hand, occurs when an application allows malicious scripts to be injected into web pages that are viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website. By identifying these vulnerabilities, interns gain an understanding of how insecure coding practices can compromise application security.

## Objectives of the task
To understand the importance of web application security in protecting user data and system resources.
To gain practical knowledge of security testing techniques used in real-world web applications.
To identify common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
To analyze how improper input validation and insecure coding practices lead to security flaws.
To perform manual and/or tool-based testing on a sample web application.
To develop the ability to think like an attacker while following ethical security practices.
To assess the impact and risk level of identified vulnerabilities.
To learn how to document security issues in a professional security testing report.
To suggest effective mitigation and prevention strategies for each identified vulnerability.
To improve awareness of secure coding standards and best security practices (e.g., OWASP guidelines).
To build hands-on experience that strengthens skills in cybersecurity and web application testing.

## Tools and Technologies used
OWASP ZAP – Web vulnerability scanning.

## Steps to Execute the Project
Select a sample web application for security testing.
Understand the application functionality and flow.
Identify input fields, URLs, and parameters.
Perform manual testing for SQL Injection and XSS.
Use tools (OWASP ZAP / Burp Suite) to scan for vulnerabilities.
Analyze scan results and verify vulnerabilities manually.
Document identified security issue.
Suggest mitigation and prevention techniques.
Prepare a security testing report with screenshots.
Review and finalize the report for submission.
